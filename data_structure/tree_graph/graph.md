# Graphs
A tree is actually a type of graph, but not all graphs are tree. Simply put, a tree is a connected graph without cycles.

A graph is simply a collection of nodes with edges between (some of) them.
- Graph can be either directed (like the following graph) or undirected. While directed edges are like a one-way street, undirect edges are like a two-way street.
- The graph might consist of multiple isolated subgraphs. If there is a path between every pair of vertices, it is called a "connected graph"
- The graph can also have cycles (or not). An "acyclic graph" is one without cycles
